# Competitive programming guideline


## About
This is another guide about the basic topics in competitive programming,
the main goal in this project is to be a reference for students at UTP.

## Meetings
There are weekly meetings at R-214 (Universidad Tecnol√≥gica de Pereira),
feel free to assist there and make questions, solve problems and have fun (:

The meetings are every thursday at 4pm.

We encourage everyone to take part of this project, 
even if you don't like the competitive programming. 
There are really amazing topics to learn about.

## Aditional Resources.
